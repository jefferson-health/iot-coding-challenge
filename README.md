# Challenge

Wanna join the bestest most amazingest team at DICE? WHO DOESN'T?! Gotta do this challenge first tho.

Using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) complete the tasks below. Use any module you deem necessary. You will totally maybe 
be judged on your use of tabs v spaces or spaces v tabs. Once completed, please push it to your personal Github account. 
You totally wanna update your README jawn, just in case there are special instructions to git'er going.

## Tasks

1. Create an account and obtain an API key with Using [openweatherapi](https://openweathermap.org/api) (Don't worry it's free)
2. Design an RESTful API Backend keeping in mind scalability (should your router be a file or directory?)
3. Build and Node Express server with the following routes. (Please think about how the endpoints should be organized, what makes more sense, GET, PUT ort POST?)
	* ROUTE 1: Get the weather based on the `city`. This includes the high, low, and weather description. Since the
	weather changes throughout the day get the weather description closest to the current time. The response to the user should be in JSON format.
	* ROUTE 2: Get the forecast based on the `city` and the `numberDay`. Ex "What is the four day forecast in Tokyo?". This should respond with data
	about the high, low, and weather description for each day.
4. Write some tests for your API, even one would be nice to see. We are a test driven shop!
5. We will be pulling your code and hitting your server via postman. Make sure it works!

**BONUS (Not Required) Using any technology desired build a front end that makes these calls and displays the data**

**NOTE:**
We're looking for organized coders. Files architected in a way in which the application could be scaled to engulf multiple APIs from multiple sources. 
This is your opportunity to blow us out of the water! Don't forget error handling! Good luck! Happy coding :)
